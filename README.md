Naive implementation of Russ Cox's [Regular Expression Matching Can Be Simple And Fast](http://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html)

There are two implementations so far:

 - py/ is a Python implementation. It's bad, don't look at it.
 - rust/ is a Rust implementation. It's better, but currently unfinished/untested

I haven't actually looked at Russ Cox's implementation, just his description, so the design here is likely to be bad.
